# ActionHero SlackBot Template

*visit www.actionherojs.com for more information*

I am an example project showing how to integrate ActionHero and Slack.  I listen to all the messages in any Slack channel I'm a member of, and respond to the word `hero` with a superhero image.  I do this with the action `hero`.

## To install:
(assuming you have [node](http://nodejs.org/) and NPM installed)

`npm install`

## To Run:
`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=your-token npm start`
